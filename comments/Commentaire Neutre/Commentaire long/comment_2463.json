{"id":2463,"article_id":2354,"message":"To my knowledge, our President has never conceded that he has or ever did make a mistake. Libya was a mistake and is now a disaster for the Libyan people. Egypt was a mistake and is now a disaster for the Egyptian people. Leaving Iraq, prematurely, spawned the growth of ISIL and all that followed. Interfering with the Syrian/Assad problem is proof that our President and his Secretaries of State learned nothing in the aforementioned disasters. \"Stuck on stupid\" ought to be their motto. The world, after almost seven years of Obama diplomacy, is not a better place. Nor is the United States in a better place domestically, after the nearly same seven, long, seemingly interminable, years. But, rest assured, anything deemed wrong is not the President\u0027s fault.","author":"harrytaft","disqus_parent":"NULL","disqus_id":"2292993387","status":"fresh","statusParsed":0,"owner":"","questionAnswer":{"Est-ce un commentaire positif?":"Commentaire Neutre","Est-ce un commentaire long?":"Commentaire long"}}
