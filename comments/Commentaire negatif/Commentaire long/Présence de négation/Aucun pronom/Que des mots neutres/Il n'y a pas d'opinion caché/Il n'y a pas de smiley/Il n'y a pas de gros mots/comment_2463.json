{"id":2463,"article_id":2354,"message":"To my knowledge, our President has never conceded that he has or ever did make a mistake. Libya was a mistake and is now a disaster for the Libyan people. Egypt was a mistake and is now a disaster for the Egyptian people. Leaving Iraq, prematurely, spawned the growth of ISIL and all that followed. Interfering with the Syrian/Assad problem is proof that our President and his Secretaries of State learned nothing in the aforementioned disasters. \"Stuck on stupid\" ought to be their motto. The world, after almost seven years of Obama diplomacy, is not a better place. Nor is the United States in a better place domestically, after the nearly same seven, long, seemingly interminable, years. But, rest assured, anything deemed wrong is not the President\u0027s fault.","author":"harrytaft","disqus_parent":"NULL","disqus_id":"2292993387","status":"fresh","statusParsed":0,"owner":"","questionAnswer":{"Est-ce qu\u0027il y a une opinion cachée?":"Il n\u0027y a pas d\u0027opinion caché","Est-ce qu\u0027il y a un smiley?":"Il n\u0027y a pas de smiley","Est-ce un commentaire positif?":"Commentaire negatif","Est-ce qu\u0027il y a un pronom?":"Aucun pronom","Est-ce qu\u0027il y a des gros mots?":"Il n\u0027y a pas de gros mots","Est-ce un commentaire long?":"Commentaire long","Est-ce qu\u0027il y a une négation?":"Présence de négation","Présence de mots positifs?":"Que des mots neutres"}}
