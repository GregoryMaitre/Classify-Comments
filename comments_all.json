Egypt was a mistake and is now a disaster for the Egyptian people. Leaving Iraq, prematurely, spawned the growth of ISIL and all that followed. Interfering with the Syrian/Assad problem is proof that our President and his Secretaries of State learned nothing in the aforementioned disasters. \"Stuck on stupid\" ought to be their motto. The world, after almost seven years of Obama diplomacy, is not a better place. Nor is the United States in a better place domestically, after the nearly same seven, long, seemingly interminable, years. But, rest assured, anything deemed wrong is not the President\'s fault.",

This came from Russian intelligence files declassified in 1992.  The CIA received some information about it but was unable to verify it per Kennedy\'s requirement.

The only heartless ones are the NRA and gun manufacturers who constantly lie to gun owners/members of NRA or other pro-gun groups in order to simply make more money. Both with Obama, and Clinton before him, whenever there is a Democrat in office there is the constant claims that the guberment is coming to take our guns. They use the distrust that conservatives/gun nuts already have of Democrats to line their pocket. Half of the commercials on FoxNews are about telling people to buy prepper stuff in the event of our crazy socialist (aka: just left of center) crashes our economy, establishes martial law, or simply lets terrorists nuke us. Hell, Sean Hannity himself has his own brand of prepper gear, as does Glenn Beck. The other half is of course telling people to trade in their money for gold since, once again, Obama just isn\'t hurting the economy with his liberal beliefs but is PURPOSELLY scheming to crash our economy. \n\nThey prey on their fears to line their pockets, period. The reasoning behind why we can\'t pass expanded background checks had NOTHING to do with background checks and was met with the argument of if we let expanded background checks happen then it will lead to a national Gun registry by the federal government! This is despite the fact that the bill contained language that explicitly would ban the creation of any such registry.\n\nOur gun violence problem is so out of control compared to the rest of the advanced world that even small changes could help save the lives of thousands. There is PLENTY that can be done that allows responsible gun owners to protect their home, hunt, or shoot at the range and also would address our gun violence problem.\n\nThe other problem is that many conservatives refuse to even admit we have a gun violence problem. It\'s a mental health problem, a family problem, or too much violence in video games and TV, it\'s not because there is more guns that people in this country they repeat like parrots. If that were true then why is it that Japan, the U.K., Australia, Canada, and the rest of the advanced countries in the world play all of the same video games as Americans and watch all of the same shows and movies. Why is it they have managed to almost completely eliminate mass gun violence in some cases, like in the U.K. or Japan, while it is still so maddeningly prevelant here?",

Part of the problem with this country right now is Politics has become a 2 viewpoint Hellhole. Everyone on each side thinks the other is wrong, but where 20 years ago people would talk about viewpoints to try and reach the middle, Now the powers that be do EVERYTHING to divide us all. They Polarize every possible issue, and throw fuel on the fire. If this country is every going to get on the uphill side and come together, then Both sides need to quit the attack and hold your ground stance. We need to be able to discuss issues so both sides understand each other more. \n\nSo Keep this in mind whichever \"side\" you think you are. This country and this world are not in good shape. If you are choosing to discuss a viewpoint with the other side, do it, but do NOT make it about \"winning\" the argument. That is what destroys us all, make it about the subject, not Personal attacks, strawman arguments, and threats.\n\nYou all know what I am talking about, if you agree with me, then join me in keeping it civil when you disagree with someone. If not, then just add to the noise on social media while the country and the world circle the drain.",

The guy showed proper restraint - he couldn\'t tell who was the bad guy so he did not draw his weapon.  This is not a point against CCW, this is evidence that CCW holders aren\'t wild west vigilantes eager to gun down anyone they can.  Nice try though!\n\nIt\'s also interesting how the author neglects to mention how many have the circumstance as \"unknown\" for 3267 firearms homicides.  Gee, if they weren\'t able to find the killer or the reason, say for a gang related drive by shooting, that might skew the figures a bit.  Considering that 3267 is fully 40% of the 8124 firearms homicides, that creates a heck of a lot of wiggle room in your suppositions.\n\nEspecially since \"arguments\" are pretty easy to identify who was behind since they escalate into an altercation, while drug related homicides can be long standing fueds between rival gangs.\n\nWho am I kidding, this author wouldn\'t admit this.",

I have been in three situations in my life where I WISHED i\'d had a gun even if I wouldn\'t have been able to deploy it at the immediate second. Twice I was stabbed, and the third I was hit with a pipe. Would a gun have made a difference? I can\'t say for sure, but I can tell you that it COULD have. Thankfully i\'ve had extensive hand to hand combat training from starting from the time I was four years old. It\'s really the only reason these three incidents have only left me with minor injuries that have since healed over the years. I do have a firearm now though and have since defused a situation involving a man approaching me with a pair of brass knuckles looking to instigate a fight because I refused to give him spare change while coming out of a store.",

Why is it Democrats the federalist are ones fighting civilians having guns. Why is it that they also instead of restricting handguns. Which are used in almost all homicides are cheap easily concealed. \n\nThey instead insist on attacking the most assault weapons. Which while yes they look scary are despite being most popular choice for gun owners are RARELY used in crimes. Because first and foremost average assault weapon runs thousands of dollars. Top it off there is a extreme demand meaning long waiting periods and short supply at stores. \n\nBut it is quite clear purpose look at all of bill of rights. Each ammendment clearly gives people power/leverage over government. Now second ammendment is the only one of those rights that is not dependent on congresses approval. Seriously everything including right to vote right to freely discuss things on a internet comment section are a single vote away from being gone.\n\nIf dems really cared about gun violence they would focus on pistols/gangs/drugs seriously the extremely heavy majority of gun deaths in us involve one or more of those things. Its about eroding peoples power and indenpendence from a federal control. \n\nAnd its why yet again new legislation will fail. Because they will talk things like gun registry (which if point is to resist tyranny and tyranny has a hit list of everyone capable of resisting \"not a very effective tool). Or things like mental health they will leave intentionally vague. Realizing every single idiosyncracy is technically mental illness easy 30% of people could be classified/ disqualified from gun ownership under their vague guidelines. Or doing things like banning lead bullets which would increase cost of bullets decrease home reloading and decreasing production facilitys capabilitys. Claiming it is a environmental hazard when reality is it would price average gun owner out of bullets effectively making gun ownership moot.",

More guns equals more dead people.\nThe logical fallacy that these gun crazies fail to consider is that everyehere else in the world does not have the problem you are trying to solve with \'more guns\' - these problems were solved by removing the guns. To stop a massacre being carried out with a gun requires that someone start to massacr people first.\nNo guns no massacres.\nFurther: do you really want Mr Citizen with a gun doing the policing in your community?

I think another part of the story that almost never gets told, perhaps partly because many of the older journalistic corporations would embarass themselves in the telling, is the role of anti-communism in the revival of the Republican Party. Public perceptions of where Reagan and Carter stood on opposition to the USSR, both substantively and in terms of competence, certainly played a role in the 1980 election and corresponding realignment.\n\nAgain, this would be a great piece if it didn\'t claim to be more than it is.

Two recessions and rising oil prices had cut deeply into profits. A surge in imports, fomented by overseas investment and trade liberalization dating to the Eisenhower administration, was crushing manufacturing with a ferocity that made the 1956 Japanese “dollar blouse” crisis look quaint. Every week, another American textile mill closed.\n\nBut the downturn wasn’t temporary. After World War II, a third of U.S. workers had been employed in an industrial sector that produced sixty percent of the world’s manufactured goods. By Milliken’s death in 2010, industry’s share of the U.S. workforce would drop to one in ten. The U.S. trade deficit in goods today stands at more than $740 billion.}-\n\nIF the GOP had remained pro TARIFF and in favor of strictly limited and controlled immigration they would not be facing certain demographic extiction to the permanent rising share of the population that is Government welfare dependent. \"Free\" trade combined with mass immigration for cheap labor guarantees a near permanent State of a declining wage scale combined with a rising number of people on Government assistance. Economic EQUILIBRIUM under \"free\"  trade means wages and standards in the USA must continuing declining until they reach their new \"normal\" at parity with the World\'s far lower median averages. \n\nPoverty guarantees welfare dependent \"reliable\" Democratic voters, the GOP establishment offering nothing to entice voters who already pay no Federal income tax. The GOP is in the bizzare situation where its chief \"donors\"- \"free\" trade multinational corporations and the financial sector- are hardcore advocates and directly profit from the policies that guarantee the demise of the Party. One would think a political Party\'s chief goal is to win elections.\n\nEither the GOP establishment will change change its position on the twin key issues of TARIFFS and mass immigration for cheap labor or they will simply cease to exist as a national political Party. Their current \"donor\" class will most likely have to be changed to achieve that.\n\nRead more: http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/10/roger-milliken-republican-party-history-213212#ixzz3nY7dWMNe",

What happened next is murky. By some accounts, when DeLay reported back to his fellow leaders later that Thursday night, he brought news that the rebels wanted Gingrich to be succeeded by Paxon, not Armey, who was next in line.

Bear in mind that the undocumented and legal non citizens are not eligible to vote nor do they vote as it is a felony for them to vote.  The author is erroneous in implying that the states with the higher undocumented resident populations and hence a larger number of electoral votes swing Democrat.  The way a state votes, red or blue, is dependent on the politcal leaning of the voting population, not the presence of a large number of undocumented or non voting non citizens.  The latter\'s presence just increaes the number of electoral votes and hence the effect which increases the number of red or white electoral votes.  it could swing either way.  So counter to what the author implies and the erroneeous conclusion he draws, the presence of a large number of the undocumented will not help Hilary Clinton in winning the Presidency of the United States.  Comparing our electoral system to that of Mexico or for that matter any other country is bashing our Constitution.  Muster up enough votes to change the Constitution in Congress (good luck with that by the way) or shut up and stop whining.

Except no elections are bought, just won by voting in large numbers in at least four elections every four years and in some places 6-8-10 elections where voters pick dozens of candidates and then officeholders to dozens of offices.\n\nWho is Lessig working to elect to his State House in his district, and who in the rest of his State - they will be determining the laws passed by the State House.  Then there is usually the State Senate.  And the Governor.  And the mayor, town council, and school board.  And the local taxes to pay for bond issues to build things.  These are the things that have bigger impact on 99% of We the People than who is elected President.\n\nThe anti-tax, anti-government movement that shapes the State and local elections and the resulting laws is one of people who have been educated to think in a certain blind way by academics just like Lessig who single out one issue and focus on just that point and promote that as a magic bullet solution, and if that bullet is missing, all is doomed.\n\nLessig is like Grover Norquist who has a simple idea that had appeal and that promises wonder results, a return to a totally mythical past when everything was green and coming up daisies. Lessig gets on TV and radio at the same rate as Norquist.\n\nThe difference is Norquist focuses on getting voters to defeat every single elected official who calls for hiking taxes or who votes to hike taxes.  Perhaps 50 million people buy Norquists message and vote on that basis, and the most active have concentrated in voting in Republican primaries.\n\nLessig\'s message to voters is what??  To me, it sounds like \"voting never works\" which means don\'t bother voting, unless maybe an Obama comes along.  But hey, Obama was never the dictator Lessig is promising to be - if he is elected he will single handedly get money out of politics and resign.  But if he gets rid of all elected officials to do that, why not solve every other problem that the voters won\'t vote to solve by voting in every damn election that determines who is elected to every damn elected office local, State, and the four Federal elected officials you can vote for in four years time.",

Obama himself said Iraq was stable and an example of his success, but his premature evacuation created the vacuum that created the Islamic State.   But Obama won\'t even say Islamic State, or Islamic Terrorism.   To quote Obama\'s pastor Rev. Wright \"America\'s chickens have come home to roost\" and those chickens are 7 years of Obama\'s foreign and domestic policy.   We are worse off in every way.

Medvedev playing point man.\nNeo-con Washington was however stuck firmly with its Wolfowitz Doctrine:  No state or combination of states should ever be allowed to challenge US hegemony anywhere.  And the Medvedev-Putin attempt to draw closer to the EU particularly was seen as threatening.  Hence the intensification, under Secretary Clinton, of efforts to have the State Department and the clandestine agencies of the USA back destabilization in Ukraine.  This has accomplished its purpose scotching any attempts to bring Russia into the European system.  Refer to the famous remark by Clinton\'s sidekick, Victoria Nuland:  \"Fuck the EU\".\nRussia reacts by pointedly making it clear that she will not tolerate any attempts to further weaken her defensive abilities, including the risky decision to back Assad in Syria.  \nIn our own history Medvedev and Putin remind me somewhat of Grant and Sherman who said that Grant had stood by him when he was crazy and he had stood by Grant when he was drunk, and they would stand together no matter what.",

Should he have a gun?\n\nWould it matter if he was raised right?\n\nOh, I\'m sorry. That\'s the big ugly gorrilla in the room, yes?\n\nCarnage in a classrom in Oregon, every weekend in Chicago, in a church in Charlotte. Some are nuts, yes. The movie shooter in Colorado is living in another world. But most are not out of control of their minds. They see and live in the same reality as the rest of us. But whether it\'s a gang-banger in Chicago or a good ol\' boy building bombs to attack our troops with during Jade Helm or an INCEL twit as was apparently the case in Oregon, it\'s a young man who has never been made to understand the word no and has been raised- by parents, video games or the streets- to think that the answer to his problems- no money, no love, no respect, whatever- is violence.\n\nWe have one of these incidents and the conversation automatically goes to guns and mental illness. A gun is a tool and mental illness is a cop-out. More women killed by husbands and boyfriends in their living rooms since 911 than all killed in the 911 attack and all our troops killed in combat since. That\'s not a mass breakout of insanity only affecting men and if it was caused by guns, then why are the vast majority of killings done by men? Where are the women mass killers?\n\nThat\'s not insanity or guns. That\'s boys being raised wrong.",

However, the U.S. homicide rate decreased from 5.0 per 100,000 in 2009 to 4.8 per 100,000 in 2010, and 4.7 per 100,000 in 2011 and 2012, and 4.5 in 2013.  \n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center Gun Homicide Rate Down 49% Since its 1993 Peak\nIn addition, two recent studies found that firearms homicides have dropped 49% since 1993.\n\nAccording to the USDOJ: Homicide rates today are as low as they were in the 1960s.\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, non-fatal violent firearms crimes are down as well, and all non-fatal violent crimes are down as well.\n\nhttps://www2.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2009/offenses/expanded_information/data/shrtable_08.html\n\nhttp://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2010/crime-in-the-u.s.-2010/tables/10shrtbl08.xls\n\nhttp://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2011/crime-in-the-u.s.-2011/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-8\n\n http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2011/crime-in-the-u.s.-2011/tables/table-4\n\nhttp://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2012/crime-in-the-u.s.-2012/tables/4tabledatadecoverviewpdf/table_4_crime_in_the_united_states_by_region_geographic_division_and_state_2011-2012.xls\n\nhttp://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2012/crime-in-the-u.s.-2012/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded-homicide/expanded_homicide_data_table_8_murder_victims_by_weapon_2008-2012.xls\n\nhttp://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2012/crime-in-the-u.s.-2012/tables/1tabledatadecoverviewpdf/table_1_crime_in_the_united_states_by_volume_and_rate_per_100000_inhabitants_1993-2012.xls\n\nhttp://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/tables/1tabledatadecoverviewpdf/table_1_crime_in_the_united_states_by_volume_and_rate_per_100000_inhabitants_1994-2013.xls\n\nhttp://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/05/07/gun-homicide-rate-down-49-since-1993-peak-public-unaware/\n\nhttp://news.nationalpost.com/2013/05/08/u-s-gun-homicides-have-dropped-since-1993-peak-report-says/\n\nhttp://bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/htus8008.pdf\n\nhttp://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/05/07/chapter-3-non-fatal-violent-firearm-crimes/\n\nhttp://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/05/07/chapter-4-all-non-fatal-violent-crimes/\n\nWe don’t need any further restrictions on our Constitutional right to keep and bear arms.",

It is a one-issue organization which attacks any candidate who dares oppose it. There was a time when it did so to candidates in all parties but no Republican now has the cojones to oppose it, so it\'s only opposing Democrats at this time. \n\nThis kind of one-issue attack is very effective if you have the money to do it on a national scale and the NRA does. We got Prohibition for much the same reason. At a certain point, most politicians find it\'s easier to accept your position just to get you to shut up. If you\'re against abortion, for example, even if you\'re for gun control it\'s just easier to say what the NRA wants you to say because that\'s not your major focus, and they will then leave you alone.. \n\nSo how come we don\'t have Prohibition today? Because in 1928 the GOP went all-in indentifying with Prohibition. When the economy collapsed less than a year into Hoover\'s term and he was unable to do anything to ameliorate it for three years, he AND his party were discredited. The Democrats, after FDR went into office, proposed repealing the 18th Amendment on the grounds that the country had more important things to worry about. It passed within a year.\n\nSo until we have a President and a Congress which is close to as heavily Democratic as the country was in 1933, we\'re not going to be able to do ANYTHING about guns. Hillary knows this, and knows that a lot of voters are frustrated by this, and some of them may vote for her on the basis of that stand.",

She\'s basically picked the only issue that will make her even less popular in the general to run to the left on. Bernie is to the left of her on pretty much everything else - especially the economy and trade. This, however, lines up with working class voters who could swing Democrat in the general. So, I have no quarrel with someone who believes in their heart that these gun laws are needed to protect families, but if she\'s doing it to get votes, it\'s ultimately a really bad strategy for the general where she\'s going to lose many progressive voters if nominated and now will also lose libertarians and moderate and conservative 2nd amendment types. Bernie Sanders\' ideas on gun control, moreover, really aren\'t much to the right of hers. That lawsuit legislation that\'s being bandied about would be largely symbolic, not very good law in terms of precedents it could set for the alcohol or auto industry, for example, and doesn\'t actually prevent shootings. Bernie Sanders\' economic and health care plans would probably do a lot more to prevent violence in this country in the long-term, since they would help decrease the levels of despair we are experiencing as a nation.",

Perry was a square peg with a square hole to fill -- the logical hard right conservative to unite that wing of the Republican Party behind him and take down Mitt Romney. He soared to the top of the polls because of this, and if he\'d been able to simply walk and chew gum at the same time, he had a great chance to win. \n\nScott Walker was anointed with that role this time around and, like Perry, flamed out early. There is no replacement for him in the rest of the GOP field unless you want to cast Trump in that role. \n\nThe Democrats don\'t have the kind of warfare going that the GOP does. If Biden jumps in, it will be because he thinks Hillary cannot win, not because he has issues with her on any important policies. \n\nBut it\'s going to take a lot more than the present level of \"scandal\" to mortally wound Hillary. Bill was in a far worse position in 1992. The electorate basically accepted that he was an adulterer and he had Whitewater and the commodities thing out there as well. With McCarthy admitting that the Benghazi investigations were political, the GOP can\'t claim the high ground on anything for which it lacks indictment-level proof. \n\nWhatever else we don\'t know about the Clintons, we do KNOW that they can govern the nation. Bill\'s eight years in office were the last years of prosperity we have had that weren\'t built upon an unsustainable housing boom. I\'m a political junkie and I\'m ideological as they get, but most people just want to make a living. Those who remember the 1990s and just want to make a living are not going to be attracted to a party that is respectful of the kind of antics Trump and Cruz thrive upon.",

I\'m not sure what the right methodology is for the purely musical numbers--probably they should be counted as part of the length, since the presence of overtures and dance numbers is part of the musical style in the pieces in which they appear. (Also, Phantom isn\'t sung-through, but I had to look it up to be sure.)\n\nThe larger issue, though, if you want to do a fair comparison, might be that the spoken dialog in all of the shows moves at a much faster pace than the songs. So if you really wanted to find out how long Hamilton would take as a more traditional musical, you\'d have to include both spoken dialog and sung words in your count of the pacing. Musicals that are sung throughout (and most operas, for that matter) tend to have more sections where the words move at a faster pace. I\'d be curious, for instance, what kind of number Les Miserables would come in at--I suspect that it\'s a faster pace than any of the listed numbers.\n\nThis actually ought to be fairly possible information to obtain from a script and a video recording of a complete performance.",

You can say there\'s a trend, but they\'re really just returning to where they were in the first place.   Roberts, sure, there\'s a little downward drift from where he started, but it\'s way too early to tell.  Kennedy is the only one that is both more liberal than when he started and has accumulated enough time to create a reasonable sample size.  \n\nOn the other hand, the four current justices nominated by Democratic presidents all demonstrate a clear drift toward being more liberal over time.  It\'s a small sample size for Kagan and Sotomayor, but the fact that every one is more liberal than he/she was to begin with is very consistent with the thesis.\n\nI\'d bet that if you break it down by decade, almost all of the judges nominated by Republican presidents that ended up being significantly more liberal were sitting on the court in the 1950\'s to the 1970\'s.  That was a time of significant societal movement in a liberal direction.  Since then, while there\'s still been a liberal drift, it\'s more pronounced on the side of the justices nominated by Democratic presidents.  \n\nAnd yes, the Martin-Quinn data supports that.  In 1950, the court\'s median was +0.91 (basically averaging as John Roberts).  By 1967, it was -0.84 (basically averaging as Stephen Breyer).  There was a conservative backlash in the 1980\'s that took us back to +1.01 in 1988, and since then, we\'ve basically been seeing a move to 0.0.  You could call that a liberal drift, but you could also look at that as achieving balance.  The SCOTUS took a huge swing left in the 50\'s and 60\'s, then took a huge swing to the right in the 1980\'s, and since then, it\'s slowly but  surely moved to neutral.",

However, the left has disagreements on this issue; some, like Clinton and Breyer, appear to be more interested in increasing state power in all respects, while others, like Sanders, would prefer to decrease state power in some respects.

Men on the other hand tended to base overall desirability on mostly looks with personality edging intelligence (with very few rated highly or lowly across the board). \n\nIf women didn\'t like a guy, they couldn\'t bring themselves to say he was smart or still good looking.  Guys were like she\'s a stupid B, but she\'s hot and I\'d even date her. \n\nMaybe it\'s a \"men are better at compartmentalizing\" versus \"a woman\'s scorn.\"  Try it with famous people and I think you\'d get the same results. \n\nWe were doing a simple regression on: Overall Desirability = AxLooks + BxSmarts + CxPersonality, using 1-10 scales.  All responses were based on personal opinion and respondents had the option to say they had no opinion / not enough info say.",

Second, the author neglects to mention that lenders mostly \"steered\" folks to subprime loans because credit and down payment were problematical. The federal government had been pushing for substantially MORE lending in inner cities in order to make home ownership more inclusive. Several primary and secondary lenders were even REQUIRED to do so as a result of lawsuit sttlements. How else could those goals be accomplished? At any rate, citing tax abatements and various deductions available to banks, corporations, and wealthier individuals as examples of free stuff is a bit simplistic and maybe even disingenuous.

Using it to undercut a candidate\'s statement about \"free stuff\" is a red herring that relies on semantics game.  I normally enjoy reading the articles here, but this one is definitely a low point.\n\nDefining \"free stuff\" as any government benefit is disingenuous almost to the point of lying.  Confiscation of property followed by a return of *some* of that property fits no one\'s definition of \"free stuff\" . . . save demogogues who wish to deliberately mislead.\n\nTaxes are a legal confiscation of property.  (Use of the word \"confiscation\" is meant literally, without any intent to imply a negative connotation.)  Unless the benefit received exceeds the confiscated amount, the \"recipient\" has not gotten \"free stuff\"; the \"recipient\" simply has had less stuff *confiscated*.\n\nEven the point about Medicare and Social Security benefits exceeding the respective taxation amounts is disingenuous.  If the author does not know about the 1960 FLEMMING V. NESTOR Supreme Court case (though I am sure she does), she ought to familiarize herself with it.\n\nIn FLEMMING V. NESTOR, the Supreme Court agreed with the government that the Social Security tax establishes no legal or contractual right of the payee to any guaranteed benefit.  The logic used to reach this conclusion is that Congress levies the tax under its general taxation power, and is free to adjust the trust structure, the tax supporting it, and the benefits given in a variety of ways (including, but not limited to, supplementing the ability to pay benefits by using tax revenue other than that received via the FICA tax line item).  Indeed, the Social Security Amendments of 1983 directly demonstrate this; that act transferred tens of billions to the trust funds from non-FICA tax revenue.  A much more substantial source of non-FICA tax revenue into the trust funds results from future debt obligations exceeding current cash on hand for the federal government, meaning that payment to cover debt obligations provides indirect use of non-FICA tax revenues to provide Medicare and Social Security benefits.  This latter use is substantial.\n\nUnless the sum of benefits received exceeds the *total* tax paid, free stuff has not been given.  Were the author to demonstrate that more than 50% of Americans receive benefits that exceed what they paid in *total* taxes (which is true only if you remove employer-paid taxes from the equation), her point would be well taken.  Since she has not done so, what could have been a good discussion devolves into a red herring.\n\nColor me disappointed.",

One was a Prince son of deposed King, another the son of a deposed Kings physician, and the third a son of a wealthy Saudi oilman.All had closets of Gucci shoes and fine custom clothes. They had a Rolls and chauffeur bodyguard.These critters were liars, thieves, cheaters, and in general the lowest scum I have ever known.The were so abusive and dismissive of women that I had to advise the private college Dean of Men to kick them out. Apparently they were \"bought\" into this school because I was informed that that was way above the Dean\'s pay grade.All had Diplomatic Immunity which kept them out of jail until they, in a drunken drug crazed spree, killed and American citizen.None went to trial but I was told they migrated in style  to France to enter a posh school there.These animals had a quaint \"custom\" called \"The Raid\".The three would make an impromptu visit on a lower class arab. The point of this assault was to embarrass the host, break things, urinate on the floor, molest the host\'s wife and in general be obnoxious to the point of criminality. I do not know if this was their invention or a custom of the \"upper classes\".We were all relieved to see this slime go away.",

Well, at least one person did:At a White House news conference on July 12, 2007, Bush declared: “I know some in Washington would like us to start leaving Iraq now. To begin withdrawing before our commanders tell us we’re ready would be dangerous for Iraq, for the region and for the United States. It would mean surrendering the future of Iraq to al-Qaeda. It would mean that we’d be risking mass killings on a horrific scale. It would mean we’d allow the terrorists to establish a safe haven in Iraq to replace the one they lost in Afghanistan. It would mean we’d be increasing the probability that American troops would have to return at some later date to confront an enemy that is even more dangerous.”Other than not predicting that an al Qaeda offshoot would morph into ISIS, did Pres. Bush get anything wrong in his prediction?",

Then they can consolidate those gains to control the oil, control the ports, control the Persian Gulf and the Mediterranean, and can launch their forays into former Soviet bloc countries with disregard for the weak and feckless USA.

He\'s an enricher of the rich, a hater of women having control of their own bodies, a bigot, a coward when it comes to standing up to the NRA and the other gun-humpers, a nosy busy body, a bald-faced liar, and a foreign policy dunce.

Any bets???Sanders campaign apologizes to pro-Palestine activists threatened with arrestSanders’s campaign manager Jeff Weaver told Boston.com on Monday that the incident \"100 percent\" should not have happened, describing the person who told the activists to take the sign down was a \"low-level volunteer\" and wouldn\'t be working on future campaign events.“We’ve communicated to our staff to make sure nothing like this happens again,” Weaver said, according to the news outlet, adding that he reached out to the students on behalf of the campaign to apologize.So is this Susie\'s response to Bernie\'s huge rally this weekend?  Rather than talk about the huge event and his massive fund raising accomplishment, she\'s searching for negatives to tear it down.  And strangely, she failed to mention that Hillary is not likely to be a friend to the Palestinians since she stated that she will be a better friend to Israel than Obama has been.  I wonder why she didn\'t include that in this article???",

If it was secured, the State email server would have a configuration for TLS encryption for the Clinton email domains, treating it as a trusted server. The State Department mail server administrators would have had to exchange certificate components to provide for that encryption between the two servers and this would be done with the Clinton email server administrators. It would be very clear if this was done or not, and the State email server that forwards out to the Internet (possibly a forwarding or relay server in an enterprise that size) would have a configuration entry in the file specific to the Clinton domains.\n\nIf this wasn\'t done, all emails sent to Hillary were viewable by anyone at any point on any wire between the two servers (including intelligence agencies that would be in a position to scoop it up, ours and others that occasionally compromise network service provider routers). \n\nIf it was done, someone had to specifically instruct the server admins to make this configuration change. A service desk ticket would likely be associated and it would have been authorized by people who might reveal who gave Ms. Clinton authorization to run her personal server for official State messaging communications.",

That’s in contrast to the White House and the rest of the executive branch. Official emails there are supposed to be retained, though the controversy over Clinton’s use of a personal email account while secretary of state has exposed vague and inconsistent requirements from one agency to another.\n\n    But if the rules at federal agencies are unclear, at least there are rules. On Capitol Hill, there are almost none. That means that the same House Republicans who are subpoenaing Clinton’s emails as part of their inquiry into the Benghazi, Libya, attacks are not required to retain emails of their own for future inspection by anyone.\n\nHouse Republicans are contemplating no less than three investigations into Hillary Clinton’s emails. Some in the House have gone as far as to suggest that the full House could subpoena the Clinton email server. The news that House Republicans have exempted themselves from the same standard that they are trying to hold Hillary Clinton has pushed this story from being ridiculous to absurdity.\n\nHow can anyone take the Republican angst over Clinton’s emails seriously when they took steps to exempt themselves from having to save any of their own emails? Republicans suggest that they are different and that the public doesn’t need to see their emails. In other words, Boehner’s House is telling the American people to trust them.\n\nIf there is one thing that Americans have learned since Republicans took control of the House, it is that they should never be trusted. The Republican hypocrisy is par for the course for the party of do as I say, not as I do. In the coming days and months, House Republicans are going to try to make a mountain out of the Clinton email molehill, but every time they mention emails, Boehner and company should be asked why they keep their emails hidden from the public.\n\nPlaying the email game is destined to backfire on the Republican Party.",

Then why did she for years, and well after she had left her position as SoS? That was nothing but intentionally keeping it from the public, and then stated at her UN press conference that \"the server will remain with me.\" No intention of keeping anything from the public, just the FBI having to practically rip the server out of her hands. Her actions, besides unprofessional and deceitful, smell of a cover up whatever it may be. She is out of her mind, very much like Nixon -- making up reality on her terms, if you recall the Watergate era. Her lawyer has now been told to get her emails from whatever ISP (like Blackberry) she used for her emailing between Jan. - March 2009. Why, because she has kept them from the public. First she said she had given all emails, but no --- telling Chuck Todd when he asked her about the missing first 2 months of emails in an interview, \"I really wasn\'t that focused on my emails.\" Focused? They\'re public records! I hope the public wakes up in time to keep this dishonest and unethical person out of the White House.

I say drone strikes and support of the local troops is the way to go.   Let Putin\'s boys enjoy the meat grinder of the Middle East for awhile. \n\nSince none of you have the courage to say what we should be doing, I suggest you hit a few more elementry school playgrounds and pick up some new insults.  Its clearly the only play you muppets have left.",
