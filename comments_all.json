They use the distrust that conservatives/gun nuts already have of Democrats to line their pocket. Half of the commercials on FoxNews are about telling people to buy prepper stuff in the event of our crazy socialist (aka: just left of center) crashes our economy, establishes martial law, or simply lets terrorists nuke us. Hell, Sean Hannity himself has his own brand of prepper gear, as does Glenn Beck. The other half is of course telling people to trade in their money for gold since, once again, Obama just isn't hurting the economy with his liberal beliefs but is PURPOSELLY scheming to crash our economy. \n\nThey prey on their fears to line their pockets, period. The reasoning behind why we can't pass expanded background checks had NOTHING to do with background checks and was met with the argument of if we let expanded background checks happen then it will lead to a national Gun registry by the federal government! This is despite the fact that the bill contained language that explicitly would ban the creation of any such registry.\n\nOur gun violence problem is so out of control compared to the rest of the advanced world that even small changes could help save the lives of thousands.

The way a state votes, red or blue, is dependent on the politcal leaning of the voting population, not the presence of a large number of undocumented or non voting non citizens.

Then there is usually the State Senate.  And the Governor.  And the mayor, town council, and school board.  And the local taxes to pay for bond issues to build things.  These are the things that have bigger impact on 99% of We the People than who is elected President.\n\nThe anti-tax, anti-government movement that shapes the State and local elections and the resulting laws is one of people who have been educated to think in a certain blind way by academics just like Lessig who single out one issue and focus on just that point and promote that as a magic bullet solution, and if that bullet is missing, all is doomed.\n\nLessig is like Grover Norquist who has a simple idea that had appeal and that promises wonder results, a return to a totally mythical past when everything was green and coming up daisies. Lessig gets on TV and radio at the same rate as Norquist.\n\nThe difference is Norquist focuses on getting voters to defeat every single elected official who calls for hiking taxes or who votes to hike taxes.  Perhaps 50 million people buy Norquists message and vote on that basis, and the most active have concentrated in voting in Republican primaries.\n\nLessig's message to voters is what??  To me, it sounds like \"voting never works\" which means don't bother voting, unless maybe an Obama comes along.  But hey, Obama was never the dictator Lessig is promising to be - if he is elected he will single handedly get money out of politics and resign.

It is a one-issue organization which attacks any candidate who dares oppose it. There was a time when it did so to candidates in all parties but no Republican now has the cojones to oppose it, so it's only opposing Democrats at this time. \n\nThis kind of one-issue attack is very effective if you have the money to do it on a national scale and the NRA does. We got Prohibition for much the same reason. At a certain point, most politicians find it's easier to accept your position just to get you to shut up. If you're against abortion, for example, even if you're for gun control it's just easier to say what the NRA wants you to say because that's not your major focus, and they will then leave you alone.. \n\nSo how come we don't have Prohibition today? Because in 1928 the GOP went all-in indentifying with Prohibition. When the economy collapsed less than a year into Hoover's term and he was unable to do anything to ameliorate it for three years, he AND his party were discredited. The Democrats, after FDR went into office, proposed repealing the 18th Amendment on the grounds that the country had more important things to worry about. It passed within a year.\n\nSo until we have a President and a Congress which is close to as heavily Democratic as the country was in 1933, we're not going to be able to do ANYTHING about guns.

Wasn't Hubert Humphrey-- the sitting V.P.-- a late entrant in 1968-- because LBJ ended his quest in admittedly a very different calendar-- and he won the nomination?\n\n\"he has to do better in the polls than he is doing right now\"  Well, Duh. But Biden has the potential advantages of:\n\na) a much more powerful media burst, given both his position, the drama of his personal saga and, I must say this since much of 538 has been discounting it, the huge doubts felt about the Clinton candidacy by both Dem primary voters and the press;\n\nb) the fact that HRC now trails several of the potential GOP nominees in key states and/or the nation, making the possibility of superdelegate, fundraisers, and other defections from Clinton to Biden very real;\n\nc) the distinct possibility of a \"cascade effect\"-- Hillary's candidacy has largely been built on the foundation of inevitability and making gender history-- if the first disappears, is the second strong enough to keep her viable? Will Bernie Sanders become Biden's real competitor??\n\nThe problem-- and i sympathize since all of us observers have been flummoxed by almost every development this year-- is that this seems like a year where you can throw out all the precedents.", "author":"Paul Maslin", "disqus_parent":"NULL", "disqus_id":"NULL", "status":"fresh", "status_parsed":0, "owner":""},

Roberts, sure, there's a little downward drift from where he started, but it's way too early to tell.  Kennedy is the only one that is both more liberal than when he started and has accumulated enough time to create a reasonable sample size.  \n\nOn the other hand, the four current justices nominated by Democratic presidents all demonstrate a clear drift toward being more liberal over time.  It's a small sample size for Kagan and Sotomayor, but the fact that every one is more liberal than he/she was to begin with is very consistent with the thesis.\n\nI'd bet that if you break it down by decade, almost all of the judges nominated by Republican presidents that ended up being significantly more liberal were sitting on the court in the 1950's to the 1970's.

 {"id":2956, "article_id":2737, "message":"The point of the article - to demonstrate how widely used government services are - is a good one.  Using it to undercut a candidate's statement about \"free stuff\" is a red herring that relies on semantics game.  I normally enjoy reading the articles here, but this one is definitely a low point.\n\nDefining \"free stuff\" as any government benefit is disingenuous almost to the point of lying.  Confiscation of property followed by a return of *some* of that property fits no one's definition of \"free stuff\" . . . save demogogues who wish to deliberately mislead.\n\nTaxes are a legal confiscation of property.  (Use of the word \"confiscation\" is meant literally, without any intent to imply a negative connotation.)  Unless the benefit received exceeds the confiscated amount, the \"recipient\" has not gotten \"free stuff\"; the \"recipient\" simply has had less stuff *confiscated*.\n\nEven the point about Medicare and Social Security benefits exceeding the respective taxation amounts is disingenuous.  If the author does not know about the 1960 FLEMMING V. NESTOR Supreme Court case (though I am sure she does), she ought to familiarize herself with it.\n\nIn FLEMMING V. NESTOR, the Supreme Court agreed with the government that the Social Security tax establishes no legal or contractual right of the payee to any guaranteed benefit.  The logic used to reach this conclusion is that Congress levies the tax under its general taxation power, and is free to adjust the trust structure, the tax supporting it, and the benefits given in a variety of ways (including, but not limited to, supplementing the ability to pay benefits by using tax revenue other than that received via the FICA tax line item).  Indeed, the Social Security Amendments of 1983 directly demonstrate this; that act transferred tens of billions to the trust funds from non-FICA tax revenue.  A much more substantial source of non-FICA tax revenue into the trust funds results from future debt obligations exceeding current cash on hand for the federal government, meaning that payment to cover debt obligations provides indirect use of non-FICA tax revenues to provide Medicare and Social Security benefits.  This latter use is substantial.\n\nUnless the sum of benefits received exceeds the *total* tax paid, free stuff has not been given.  Were the author to demonstrate that more than 50% of Americans receive benefits that exceed what they paid in *total* taxes (which is true only if you remove employer-paid taxes from the equation), her point would be well taken.  Since she has not done so, what could have been a good discussion devolves into a red herring.\n\nColor me disappointed.", "author":"Ryan O'Donnell", "disqus_parent":"NULL", "disqus_id":"NULL", "status":"fresh", "status_parsed":0, "owner":""},

They can do it by proxy first, while they make billions off cheap oil, weapons sales, and trade with those countries. Then they can consolidate those gains to control the oil, control the ports, control the Persian Gulf and the Mediterranean, and can launch their forays into former Soviet bloc countries with disregard for the weak and feckless USA. China will also take advantage of the situation and solidify their position in their part of the world.The most interesting thing is how does Russia interact so well with Iranian Shiite Mullahs, Iraqi Sunni Muslims and Chinese Communists?

Kevin McCarthy, the presumed successor to Boehner as House Speaker, for his recent unforced error when he remarked that the Benghazi investigation is aimed at derailing Hillary. I happen to agree with Parker on every point. His words showed a stunning arrogance and bad judgment and instantly undermined months of fine work that Gowdy and the committee have done to get at the truth. To top it off, his attempt to undo the damage the next day was pathetic and laughable. \n\nIf R\u2019s choose to overlook his gaffe (IMO, too kind a term to describe his remarks) and elect him anyway, then Hillary will be gifted ----has already been gifted ---- by claiming the political high ground. She and her supporters will continue to try taking R\u2019s completely off message on Benghazi and her email fiasco. McCarthy\u2019s words will be played over and over in many democrat ads, not just Hillary\u2019s.

But we can do it without any bloodshed or violence but  it is going to take a team effort to get the congress to call the convention. \n\nThere is one sure way to stop this totalitarian usurpation of power and that is to call for an article 5 convention and have this amendment be one of the first to be ratified.\n\nThere is one amendment that would stop this in it's tracks and that would only be passed in a Article V convention as the congress does not have the intestinal fortitude to enact it. That amendment would give the states the power to impeach any federal elected, appointed, or hired person with 60% of the states voting to impeach this would include the Supreme Court Justices and all other federal judges. It would also give the states the power to repeal any law, court ruling including the Supreme Court, agency rule, within 3 years of ruling or passage and the states would have 15 years after passage of this amendment to repeal any law, ruling including the Supreme court decisions, or agency, ever passed. These can be enacted by the state legislatures or by referendum of 55% of the people or a combination of referenda and or legislatures of the different states or a 51% vote of the legislatures of 60% of the total states.\n\nThe only problem with this is that state legislators would almost have to become full time or the time restrictions\n would have to be longer.\nThe next amendment would be a term limit amendment that would restrict the House to 12 years and the Senate to 12 years or a combination of the 2 to18 years and would restrict the employment of any former congressperson for 12 years from having any contact with the new congress through any means or any intermediary except if running for president.

Historically, researchers have found that when Planned Parenthood clinics close, other clinics do not step up to fill the gap. Meanwhile, when there are fewer reproductive health clinics available, women get less reproductive health care \u2014 from birth control to cancer screenings to STD testing and treatment. Unintended pregnancies would likely increase, too.\nSo while many politicians like to assert that women can \"go somewhere else,\" the consensus in the literature shows a different picture.

There are rumors ow that a lawyer in Houston, TX has evidence that it was Senators Joni Ernst and Ted Cruz that illlegally obtained those so called Planned Parenthood videos adn had them alterd. I say they are all crooks and why not investigate all of the. GOP tea baggers. If teh tea party get sthier way there will no longer be social security, medicare, medicaid, VA or Veterans benefits. I dont know about you all but I paid heavily into Social Security for 40 yerars The republicans better be prepared to payback every one for all the money paid into social security. Plus the tea baggers want to take away all healthcare insurance. No one will have a thing there haave been a couple of the tea baggers who have commented if you cant afford to pay for your own health care you better just die. Ted Cruz is just a lil Hitler adn the teabaggers aree wanting to overthrow the US Government. They call themselves patriots when they are actually Benedict Arnold traitors. they have all already proven  tehy are all treasonists to the USA. As far as guns tehy support because all that fat lobby money tehy get from teh NRA and gun manufacturers. Plus they are owned adn controlled by all the dark money from teh Koch Brothers. People  esp rednecks adn hillbillies yea second ammendment when it comes to guns. read the 2nd ammendment fully when it talks about armed militias that means the National Guard not a damn redneck group of thugs like that old bastard in Nevada and letting his cattle graze on open land. Ronald Reagan was right the day he left office he switched back to being a democrat and he did not support the Bush clan at all. I say the GOP in all its notable glory has handed the WH and teh House and Senate to the Democrat in 2016 and thankfully so. Washington was getting some stuff done at least till the tea party started getting elected. people better be thankful that Boehner fought the teabags and kept some of thier actions from hurting us americans. Ted Cruz is a canadian his dad a cuban his mom was born either in Scotland or Ireland. His dad said his citizenship here was boutght and paid for and Ted say it was bribery. Either way he was not NATIVE BORN as the constitution calls for and he should not even be able to run for the WH. Also, the SCOTUS is not to make ruling based on politucal party lines. they are suppossed to take laws and measure tehm to the US Constition for thier legality adn that is the way it should be done. Ted Cruz took his oath of senate office while he was still a citizen of Canada go figure on that legal issue. He did not give that canadian citizenship up till after he was a senator. One of my graduate school projects in cultural diversity  had me looking back at our forfathes who wrote the US Constitution. and they clearly wanted religion and politics to be kept apart and not mixed together. to prevent some of the legal crap going on today likethe BS with kim Davis. People only know a word here and there from the Constitution and basically they make up the rest as they see it from the Lies and. BS from the congress, senate GOP and garbage spewing from people like Kim Davis and her gaggle of illiterate farmhand redneck hillbillies. who gives a shit who marries who and goes on to live thier own private lives in thier home. in Kim Davis case all she was asked to do is issue a licence not to preform a wedding just a piece of papper for 85.00. No one was forcing anything down her throat but in turn she was forcing her religion upon others and that is what our forefathers did specifically want to prevent people from doing.

Republicans suggest that they are different and that the public doesn\u2019t need to see their emails.

Clinton admittedhaving se x with the girl, but claimed it was consensual. The victim's family declined to pursue the case;\u2022In 1972, a 22-year-old woman told campus police atYale University that she was s exua lly assaulted by Clinton, a law student at the college. No charges were filed, but retired campus policemen contacted by Capitol Hill Blue confirmed the incident. The woman, tracked down by Capitol Hill Blue last week, confirmed the incident, but declined to discuss it further and would not give permission to use her name;\u2022In 1974, a female student at the University of Arkansascomplained that then-law school instructor Bill Clinton tried to prevent her from leaving his office during a conference. She said he gr oped her and forced his hand inside her blouse. She complained to her faculty advisor whoconfronted Clinton, but Clinton claimed the student ''came on'' to him. The student left the school shortly after the incident. Reached at her home in Texas, the former student confirmed the incident, but declined to go on therecord with her account. Several former students at the University have  confirmed the incident in confidential interviews and said there were other reports of Clinton attempting to force himself on female students;\u2022Juanita Broaddrick, a volunteer in Clinton's gubernatorialcampaign, said he ra ped her in 1978. Mrs. Broaddrick suffered a bruised and torn lip, which she said she suffered when Clinton bit her during the ra p e.She stated Bill ra pe d her multiple times, and bit nearly entirely through her lip. Hillary learned of this assualt with hours;\u2022From 1978-1980, during Clinton's first term as governor ofArkansas, state troopers assigned to protect the governor were aware of at least seven complaints from women who said Clinton forced, or attempted toforce, himself on them s exual ly. One retired state trooper said in an interview that the common joke among those assigned to protect Clinton was \"who's next?\". One former state trooper said other troopers would often escort women to the governor's hotel room after political events, often more than one an evening;\u2022Carolyn Moffet, a legal secretary in Little Rock in 1979, saidshe met then-governor Clinton at a political fundraiser and shortly thereafter received an invitation to meet the governor in his hotel room.\"I was escorted there by a state trooper. When I went in, he was sitting on a couch, wearing only an undershirt. He pointed at his p en is and told me to s uc k it. I told him I didn't even do that for my boyfriend and he got mad,grabbed my head and shoved it into his lap. I pulled away from him and ran out of the room.\"\u2022Elizabeth Ward, the Miss Arkansas who won the Miss America crown in 1982, told friends she was forced by Clinton to have s ex with himshortly after she won her state crown. Last year, Ward, who is now married with the last name of Gracen (from her first marriage), told an interviewer she did have se x with Clinton but said it was consensual. Close friends of Ward,however, say she still maintains privately that Clinton forced himself on her.\u2022Paula Corbin, an Arkansas state worker, filed a se xua lharassment case against Clinton after an encounter in a Little Rock hotel room where the then-governor exp osed himself and demanded or al sex.Clinton settled the case with Jones recently with an $850,000 cash payment.\u2022Sandra Allen James, a former Washington, DC, politicalfundraiser says Presidential candidate-to-be Clinton invited her to his hotel room during a political trip to the nation's capital in 1991, pinned her against the wall and stuck his hand up her dress. She says she screamed loudenough for the Arkansas State Trooper stationed outside the hotel suite to bang on the door and ask if everything was all right, at which point Clinton released her and she fled the room. When she reported the incident to her boss, he advised her to keep her mouth shut if she wanted to keep working. Miss James has since married and left Washington. Reached at her home last week, theformer Miss James said she later learned that other women suffered the same fate at Clinton's hands when he was in Washington during his Presidential run.\u2022Christy Zercher, a flight attendant on Clinton's leasedcampaign plane in 1992, says Presidential candidate Clinton ex posed himself to her, grabbed her br ea st s and made explicit remarks about or al s ex. A videoshot on board the plane by ABC News shows an obviously inebriated Clinton with his hand between another young flight attendant's legs. Zercher said later inan interview that White House attorney Bruce Lindsey tried to pressure her into not going public about the assault.\u2022Kathleen Willey, a White House volunteer, reported that Clinton grabbed her, fondled her b rea st and pressed her hand against his ge nita ls during an Oval Office meeting in November, 1993. Willey, who told her story ina 60 Minutes interview, became a target of a White House-directed smear campaign after she went public.Those were the unwilling women. Willing women is a long list, to include Jenifer Flowers and young naive intern Monica Lewinsky.See above Arkansas State Troopers have long claimed taking endless streams of willing and/or paid young women to Bill.Hillary was aware of many of the events, and among her staff these \"events\" were known as \"B im bo Eruptions\".Hillary would attack the character and veracity of any victims who tried to go public. One such case:Kathleen Willey claimed in 1998 that Bill Clinton fo ndled herand put her hand on his ge nit als during a 1993 Oval Office meeting\u2022She came forward after the Monica Lewinsky s ex scandal broke\u2022Willey, a Clinton organizer in Virginia during the 1992 campaign, now blamesHillary Clinton for covering up Bill's s exu al conquests\u2022Hillary, she said Sunday in a radio interview, 'chooses to go after the womenthat he hooks up with, to ruin them again and again and again'\u2022Willey, now 6 9, wants to see Republican Carly FIorina elected: 'She's got more cojones than everybody in Washington combined who's running'Bill Cosby is finally being exposed for his ra pes, assaults,and affairs. It is time for Bill Clinton to meet the same fate.Rumors and allegations were out there for decades about Bill Cosby, but never saw the full light of day.Why? Men of wealth, power, and/or fame often operate outside the law without the same consequences everyday citizens would face.They are often protected by others who have monetary or business connections.Even the spouses often ignore the infidelities and se xu al assaults on other women to maintain the status quo, power, and wealthNow, finally, Bill Cosby is being exp osed. The accusers aregetting traction against the excusers.Seems like a great many parallels to the Bill Clintonallegations, except the excusers overwhelm the accusers.Why is Bill Clinton never fully examined for these allegations?Great power, great wealth, an enabling spouse, a complicit media, and many powerful friends in all levels of government. Payoffs, bribes, threats. But,yeah, Bill Cosby is guilty, and Bill Clinton is innocent.Then there is Bill's billionaire buddy Epstein, with his pedophi le island and private jet. I do not know whether those allegations seem true or not. Based on Bill's history, it should at least be looked into.&gt;&gt; Alleged Details Of Bill Clinton\u2019s Trip To JeffreyEpstein\u2019s O rg y Island &gt;&gt; \u2018Two Young Girls\u2019", "author":"beedogz", "disqus_parent":"2293135095", "disqus_id":"2293900649", "status":"fresh", "status_parsed":0, "owner":""},

On the contrary, Churchill, a non-vegetarian, cigar smoker and a whisky drinker died at 95. Lifespan of Indian vegetarians is shorter than European non-vegetarians. Japanese and Icelanders have a long lifespan in the world because they are meat and fish eaters. A fascinating paper recently published in the journal Mechanisms of Aging and Development presents an entirely new theory to explain why vegetarians do not live longer. It turns out that those who avoid eating beef suffer a deficiency of a nutrient (carnosine) that is critical to preventing lethal glycation reactions in the body. Carnosine has been shown to rejuvenate connective tissue cells, which may explain its beneficial effects on wound healing. Damaged proteins accumulate and cross-link in the skin, causing wrinkles and loss of elasticity. Carnosine is the most promising broad-spectrum shield against protein degradation..", "author":"Abraham Yeshuratnam", "disqus_parent":"NULL", "disqus_id":"NULL", "status":"fresh", "status_parsed":0, "owner":""},

You can say there's a trend, but they're really just returning to where they were in the first place.   Roberts, sure, there's a little downward drift from where he started, but it's way too early to tell.  Kennedy is the only one that is both more liberal than when he started and has accumulated enough time to create a reasonable sample size.  \n\nOn the other hand, the four current justices nominated by Democratic presidents all demonstrate a clear drift toward being more liberal over time.  It's a small sample size for Kagan and Sotomayor, but the fact that every one is more liberal than he/she was to begin with is very consistent with the thesis.\n\nI'd bet that if you break it down by decade, almost all of the judges nominated by Republican presidents that ended up being significantly more liberal were sitting on the court in the 1950's to the 1970's.  That was a time of significant societal movement in a liberal direction.  Since then, while there's still been a liberal drift, it's more pronounced on the side of the justices nominated by Democratic presidents.  \n\nAnd yes, the Martin-Quinn data supports that.  In 1950, the court's median was +0.91 (basically averaging as John Roberts).  By 1967, it was -0.84 (basically averaging as Stephen Breyer).  There was a conservative backlash in the 1980's that took us back to +1.01 in 1988, and since then, we've basically been seeing a move to 0.0.  You could call that a liberal drift, but you could also look at that as achieving balance.

Using it to undercut a candidate's statement about \"free stuff\" is a red herring that relies on semantics game.  I normally enjoy reading the articles here, but this one is definitely a low point.\n\nDefining \"free stuff\" as any government benefit is disingenuous almost to the point of lying.  Confiscation of property followed by a return of *some* of that property fits no one's definition of \"free stuff\" . . . save demogogues who wish to deliberately mislead.\n\nTaxes are a legal confiscation of property.  (Use of the word \"confiscation\" is meant literally, without any intent to imply a negative connotation.)  Unless the benefit received exceeds the confiscated amount, the \"recipient\" has not gotten \"free stuff\"; the \"recipient\" simply has had less stuff *confiscated*.\n\nEven the point about Medicare and Social Security benefits exceeding the respective taxation amounts is disingenuous.  If the author does not know about the 1960 FLEMMING V. NESTOR Supreme Court case (though I am sure she does), she ought to familiarize herself with it.\n\nIn FLEMMING V. NESTOR, the Supreme Court agreed with the government that the Social Security tax establishes no legal or contractual right of the payee to any guaranteed benefit.  The logic used to reach this conclusion is that Congress levies the tax under its general taxation power, and is free to adjust the trust structure, the tax supporting it, and the benefits given in a variety of ways (including, but not limited to, supplementing the ability to pay benefits by using tax revenue other than that received via the FICA tax line item).  Indeed, the Social Security Amendments of 1983 directly demonstrate this; that act transferred tens of billions to the trust funds from non-FICA tax revenue.  A much more substantial source of non-FICA tax revenue into the trust funds results from future debt obligations exceeding current cash on hand for the federal government, meaning that payment to cover debt obligations provides indirect use of non-FICA tax revenues to provide Medicare and Social Security benefits.  This latter use is substantial.\n\nUnless the sum of benefits received exceeds the *total* tax paid, free stuff has not been given.  Were the author to demonstrate that more than 50% of Americans receive benefits that exceed what they paid in *total* taxes (which is true only if you remove employer-paid taxes from the equation), her point would be well taken.

BTW, the Unions are bankrupting America so we have to break them up and drive down their wages.  Nevermind that those people will have less money to spend and the rich will have more of it.  Nevermind that it hurts the economy and drives down wages overall.  And OMG, the EPA is sucking the life out of the economy!  There really is no need to protect our environment.  America should be a free-for-all and everyone should be free to do whatever they want.  Seriously, if that happens only those that are already in positions of wealth/power will be better off.

I know that there have been honest disagreements over policy, but we also know that there's something more that has crept into our relationship. In America, there's a failure to appreciate Europe's leading role in the world. Instead of celebrating your dynamic union and seeking to partner with you to meet common challenges, there have been times where America has shown arrogance and been dismissive, even derisive.\" President Obama, Rhenus Sports Arena, Strasbourg, France, April 3, 2009\"My job to the Muslim world is to communicate that the Americans are not your enemy. We sometimes make mistakes. We have not been perfect. But if you look at the track record, as you say, America was not born as a colonial power, and that the same respect and partnership that America had with the Muslim world as recently as 20 or 30 years ago, there's no reason why we can't restore that.\" President Obama, interview with Al Arabiya, January 27, 2009\"All of us must now renew the common stake that we have in one another. I know that promises of partnership have gone unfulfilled in the past, and that trust has to be earned over time. While the United States has done much to promote peace and prosperity in the hemisphere, we have at times been disengaged, and at times we sought to dictate our terms. But I pledge to you that we seek an equal partnership. There is no senior partner and junior partner in our relations; there is simply engagement based on mutual respect and common interests and shared values. So I'm here to launch a new chapter of engagement that will be sustained throughout my administration.\" President Obama, Hyatt Regency, Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, April 17, 2009\"I would like to think that with my election and the early decisions that we've made, that you're starting to see some restoration of America's standing in the world. And although, as you know, I always mistrust polls, international polls seem to indicate that you're seeing people more hopeful about America's leadership.\" President Obama, ExCel Center, London, United Kingdom, April 2, 2009\"Unfortunately, faced with an uncertain threat, our government made a series of hasty decisions. I believe that many of these decisions were motivated by a sincere desire to protect the American people. But I also believe that all too often our government made decisions based on fear rather than foresight; that all too often our government trimmed facts and evidence to fit ideological predispositions. Instead of strategically applying our power and our principles, too often we set those principles aside as luxuries that we could no longer afford. And during this season of fear, too many of us--Democrats and Republicans, politicians, journalists, and citizens--fell silent. In other words, we went off course. And this is not my assessment alone. It was an assessment that was shared by the American people who nominated candidates for President from both major parties who, despite our many differences, called for a new approach--one that rejected torture and one that recognized the imperative of closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay.\" President Obama, speech at the National Archives, Washington, D.C., May 21, 2009\"Our two republics were founded in service of these ideals. In America, it is written into our founding documents as \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\" In France: \"Libert\u00e9\"--absolutely--\"egalit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9.\" Our moral authority is derived from the fact that generations of our citizens have fought and bled to uphold these values in our nations and others. And that's why we can never sacrifice them for expedience's sake. That's why I've ordered the closing of the detention center in Guantanamo Bay. That's why I can stand here today and say without equivocation or exception that the United States of America does not and will not torture. In dealing with terrorism, we can't lose sight of our values and who we are. That's why I closed Guantanamo. That's why I made very clear that we will not engage in certain interrogation practices. I don't believe that there is a contradiction between our security and our values. And when you start sacrificing your values, when you lose yourself, then over the long term that will make you less secure.\" President Obama, Rhenus Sports Arena, Strasbourg, France, April 3, 2009\"Every challenge that we face is more easily met if we tend to our own democratic foundation. This work is never over. That's why, in the United States, we recently ordered the prison at Guantanamo Bay closed. That's why we prohibited--without exception or equivocation--the use of torture. All of us have to change. And sometimes change is hard. Another issue that confronts all democracies as they move to the future is how we deal with the past. The United States is still working through some of our own darker periods in our history. Facing the Washington Monument that I spoke of is a memorial of Abraham Lincoln, the man who freed those who were enslaved even after Washington led our Revolution. Our country still struggles with the legacies of slavery and segregation, the past treatment of Native Americans. Human endeavor is by its nature imperfect. History is often tragic, but unresolved, it can be a heavy weight. Each country must work through its past. And reckoning with the past can help us seize a better future.\" President Obama to the Turkish Parliament, Ankara, Turkey, April 6, 2009\"Too often, the United States has not pursued and sustained engagement with our neighbors. We have been too easily distracted by other priorities, and have failed to see that our own progress is tied directly to progress throughout the Americas. My Administration is committed to the promise of a new day. We will renew and sustain a broader partnership between the United States and the hemisphere on behalf of our common prosperity and our common security.\" President Obama: \"Choosing a Better Future in the Americas,\" April 16, 2009\"There is also no question that Guantanamo set back the moral authority that is America's strongest currency in the world. Instead of building a durable framework for the struggle against al Qaeda that drew upon our deeply held values and traditions, our government was defending positions that undermined the rule of law. In fact, part of the rationale for establishing Guantanamo in the first place was the misplaced notion that a prison there would be beyond the law--a proposition that the Supreme Court soundly rejected. Meanwhile, instead of serving as a tool to counter terrorism, Guantanamo became a symbol that helped al Qaeda recruit terrorists to its cause. Indeed, the existence of Guantanamo likely created more terrorists around the world than it ever detained. So the record is clear: Rather than keeping us safer, the prison at Guantanamo has weakened American national security. It is a rallying cry for our enemies.\" President Obama, speech at the National Archives, Washington, D.C., May 21, 2009", "author":"osamabedead", "disqus_parent":"2294511737", "disqus_id":"2294593957", "status":"fresh", "status_parsed":0, "owner":""},

Under George W. Bush, the average unemployment rate was 5.3 percent.  Under Barack Obama, things have been much worse. The month after he took office the unemployment rate rose above 8 percent and it has stayed there ever since.#2 Under Barack Obama, the velocity of money (a very important indicator of economic health) has plunged to a post-World War II low.#3 Real median household income has decreased by more than 4000 dollars since Barack Obama entered the White House.#4 The United States has plenty of oil and we should not have to import it from the Middle East.  Unfortunately, Barack Obama has an absolutely nightmarish energy policy.  Under Bill Clinton, the number of drilling permits approved rose by 58 percent.  Under George W. Bush, the number of drilling permits approved rose by 116 percent.  Under Barack Obama, the number of drilling permits approved decreased by 36 percent.#5 When Barack Obama took office, the average price of a gallon of gasoline was $1.85.  Today, the average price of a gallon of gasoline is $3.71.#6 Under Barack Obama, the United States has lost more than 300,000 education jobs.#7 Since Barack Obama became president, the number of long-term unemployed Americans has risen from 2.7 million to 5.2 million.#8 For the first time in the post-World War II era, the employment-population ratio has not bounced back after a recession.  The percentage of working age Americans with a job has been below 59 percent for 35 months in a row.#9 While Barack Obama has been president, U.S. home values have fallen by another 12 percent.#10 More than three times as many new homes were sold in the United States in 2005 as will be sold in 2012.#11 Electricity bills in the United States have risen faster than the overall rate of inflation for five years in a row.  Thanks Obama.#12 When Barack Obama first entered the White House, an ounce of gold was going for about $850.  Today, the price of gold is over $1630 an ounce.#13 Since 2008, our economy has lost 1.3 million jobs while at the same time 3.6 million more Americans have been added to Social Security\u2019s disability insurance program.#14 The number of Americans on food stamps has grown from 31.9 million when Barack Obama took office to 46.4 million today.  How much more \u201chope and change\u201d are we going to be able to endure?#15 As I wrote about the other day, it is being projected that Obamacare will add 16 million more Americans to the Medicaid rolls.#16 If you can believe it (and this really is hard to believe), more than half of all Americans are now at least partially financially dependent on the government.#17 The total amount of money that the federal government gives directly to the American people has grown by 32 percent since Barack Obama became president.#18 Under Barack Obama, federal spending as a percentage of GDP (25 percent) is the highest that it has been since World War II.#19 The Obama administration has been spending money on some of the most insane things imaginable.  For example, in 2011 the Obama administration spent $592,527 on a study that sought to figure out once and for all why chimpanzees throw poop.#20 The U.S. government has run a budget deficit of well over a trillion dollars every single year under Barack Obama.#21 Under Barack Obama, U.S. debt was downgraded from AAA status for the first time ever.#22 Since Barack Obama took office, the U.S. national debt has increased by 50 percent.#23 Since Barack Obama became president, the U.S. national debt has increased by an average of more than $64,000 per taxpayer.#24 During the Obama administration, the U.S. national debt has grown more than it did from the time that George Washington became president to the beginning of Bill Clinton\u2019s second term as president.How's that?", "author":"ChaoticTremble", "disqus_parent":"2294415051", "disqus_id":"2294493637", "status":"fresh", "status_parsed":0, "owner":""},

If you want to know how medicare would work just look at how it worked for people over 65. It works exceeding well for them.    What makes you think it would cut out insurance companies?   Medicare only covers 80% of Part B allowable health care costs.   Limited coverage is covered at 60% to 70%.    Medicare recipients must buy private supplemental health care insurance (upwards to $400/month) to cover the Medicare deductibles.    II\u2019m over 65 \u2013 I know how it works.   It does NOT work exceedingly well.Admin cost for Medicare are lower than the private sector. Admin costs are lower because Medicare pays a flat rate and the recipients pay the difference.   The Medicare reimbursement has been reduced, and many doctors will no longer accept new Medicare patients if they do not have private supplemental insurance. Germany, France, Japan, Canada. They all have single payer system which are just a little more than 1/2 as expensive as our with the same of better outcomes. Japan and France offer single pay health insurance \u2013 it is very costly.   Their costs are lower \u2013 not because it is single payer \u2013 the costs are lower because they do not offer free health care to anyone who is not in the system as they do here in the US.    If the US reversed EMTALA (which Japan and France do not have) \u2013 and forced illegal aliens to pay for their own health insurance, we would save $90B a year.Germany has public/private, tiered insurance programs \u2026 it is not single payer.   Canada is now introducing private health insurance providers, doctors and hospitals because the people are tired of waiting in long queues and traveling to larger provinces for services not available in their province. =============================There is no evidence anywhere --   and you still didn't  answer my question \u2013 how do you propose Medicare for $300M people will be funded?", "author":"June Smith", "disqus_parent":"2294650984", "disqus_id":"2294693896", "status":"fresh", "status_parsed":0, "owner":""},

There will be a reason why it is okay an armed mechanic accidentally killed a 12 year old girl while trying to killl a shooter he was not trained to handle.

Citing \"sources\" who claim he \"leaked\" the story to Dowd, as though talking to a reporter whom he has known personally for years constitutes a \"leak.\"  The fact that he had talked about it to other people before he relayed it to Dowd (the WSJ reported on it in June) makes the piece even less credible.  Biden is an infamous \"talker\", and in recent months he has, naturally, wanted to talk about Beau. \n\nThen there are multiple stories expressing skepticism about his path to the nomination, questioning his motivation, suggesting he would be a \"spoiler\" who stood in the way of progress, etc.  I'm sorry, but if there is anyone who would be running for himself/herself, out of ambition and not for the country, it is Clinton. Biden is the one who has been in public service his whole life and not made himself a fortune.  Clinton?  No.\n\nThis piece is correct that Clinton thinks she was \"robbed,\" and that any candidate who dares enter the race and possibly beat her out for the nomination is \"robbing\" her.  Ditto for her diehard supporters. This is a democracy and if she can't handle the competition, maybe she isn't such a great candidate.  No doubt she would come out guns blazing, and that's fair.  But if she loses, she loses fair and sqaure and to whine she was \"robbed\" - especially when she has such an advantage with the establishment - would be poor sportsmanship to put it mildly.\n\nBiden and Clinton align politically on many issues, that is true.  But that does not mean there is no place for him in the race.  Because political alignment is where their similarities, their strengths and weaknesses, stop.  They are cut from different cloth, and he would be an entirely different kind of leader than she would be.  People should not forget that many, especially among the Republicans, have a strong aversion to her.  Biden is a deal-maker, and would be better able to get things done in this bitterly divided climate.  \n\nIt's not just about winning the primary.  It's about winning the general.  If the party wants to keep the WH, maybe they should consider who is polling better against Republicans.  Biden.  Who has higher favorables among moderate voters in swing states?

The assassination of John F. Kennedy was a coup d'etat. The shadow government of that day wanted to take over the reins of power from the people of that day, and the only way that could be done was by eliminating the standing leader and putting in place, someone whom they could manipulate and dictate to do their evil biding. Lyndon Johnson fit that bill. He already hated Kennedy and wanted to escalate the war in Viet Nam for personal reasons, \"Brown and Root\" in the Suez Canal for one. 8) Kennedy wanted to end the conflict in Viet Nam and bring our soldiers home. This too went against the shadow government who also, for financial reasons, wanted an escalation of that event. As David Ferry said it, \" It is a riddle, wrapped in a conundrum wrapped in an enigma\". The more you try to prove a good conspiracy, the more like a lunatic it makes you look. Ever since that day, November 22, 1963, the United States Government has been in the grasp of this evil cabal, and remains so today. Each and every elected official, must swear allegiance to their \"party\" or otherwise, declare themselves to be independent, which has a negative connotation. Right wing or Left wing, they are both attached to the same wicked bird. One of the chief players in the game has been, and still to some degree is George H.W. Bush. Of course, at 93 years of age, or whatever, he is not as active as he once was, but his influence still runs deep. Through every president since Johnson, with the possible exception of Jimmy Carter. Gerald Ford was an obvious plant. Richard Nixon was shot down in flames of dishonor when he refused to play their game. Ronald Reagan was G.H.W.'s marionette. An actor playing a role. Then of course G.H.W. himself, but soon he realized he could run things better if not in the lime-light. Enter his young prodigy Billary Clinton. Then of course, Little George, with H.W.'s understudy ventriloquist Dick Cheney. They controled the drug trade, they control the oil industry, the banking system in the US., The Supreme Court, The House and Senate, The WAR MACHINE, and on and on.  Though I can not definatively say that every politician in federal office today is aware of these facts, I do feel confident in saying that the large majority of them are aware, to some degree, and are either compliciate after the fact, or are simply crippled by the fear that they are powerless to affect any change in the status quo.  \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNutyu3ypDo", "author":"Carl Giesse", "disqus_parent":"NULL", "disqus_id":"NULL", "status":"fresh", "status_parsed":0, "owner":""},

First of all, taking the gun out of the equation does not solve the problem. One of the worst attacks I ever responded to was with an ancient Chinese \"battle axe\". The casualties were actually made worse by the fact that the thing was unsharpened, and caused more devastating wounds as a result. To further my point, a Muslim man recently beheaded his coworkers in Oklahoma, which was another attack stopped by \"good guy with a gun\", in this case, the first responding police officer. Your unlocked door analogy is simplistic. In order to arm himself, a person intending to do harm must purchase the gun at a gun store, sign the NICS forms, wait 10 days, then go back and pick it up from the store. In California, he even has to do a little test to prove he knows gun safety. None of these prevented the UCSB shooter from doing his evil work. The other alternative is to steal a gun, which is what the Sandy Hook shooter did. That's a little more work than \"entering an unlocked door.\" As far as common sense, I'll listen to any argument that demonstrates some. What is your suggestion? The expanded background checks that liberals keep harping on about are useless, and the last several of these types of shooters have passed them, with the exception of the Sandy Hook shooter, who stole the guns, and the Charleston church shooter, where a paperwork glitch allowed him to receive a gun when he really didn't qualify, another example of how useless they are. One of the reasons they are useless, by the way, is because of another liberal idea, confidentiality of information on the mentally ill. You're supposed to be disqualified from receiving a firearm if you're mentally ill, but states don't share, or even keep information on the mentally ill, because the mentally ill have privacy rights. There's another thing no one mentions in the liberal media, because it would illustrate the failure of their programs, which is what my original post on this site was about.

Therefore the power to regulate trade with other nations must be delegated by Congress to the president.\nSection 301 expanded presidential authority to retaliate against trade practices by other nations that unfairly burden or restrict U.S. commerce, whether through high tariffs or through nontariff trade barriers. The president may suspend trade concessions, impose new higher tariff rates on a selective basis\nIMPACT OF THE ACT\nPrimarily because of Section 301, the Trade Act has been used more to open foreign markets to U.S. exports and investments than to protect American industries from unfair competition. Section 301 is a unilateral provision in U.S. law that can be invoked irrespective of any remedies available under the multilateral GATT or WTO.\nAlthough the United States has generally upheld its treaty obligations under the GATT, Section 301 actions or threats of action, despite at times creating resentment from U.S. trading partners, have been highly effective tools in negotiating trade concessions.", "author":"Brent Holbert", "disqus_parent":"NULL", "disqus_id":"NULL", "status":"fresh", "status_parsed":0, "owner":""},

In a 1984 policy address, he said:\n\n\"Over the last four years the rate of return on capital investment in manufacturing in the six largest industrial countries averaged only half the rate earned during the late 1960s. . . . Even allowing for cyclical factors, a clear pattern emerges of a substantial and progressive long-term decline in rates of return on capital. There may be many reasons for this. But there is no doubt that an important contributing factor is to be found in the significant increase over the past 20 years or so in the share of income being absorbed by compensation of employees . . . This points to the need for a gradual reduction in the rate increase in real wages over the medium term if we are to it restore adequate investment incentives.\"\n\nREAD IT ALL HERE.... http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/16291-the-american-dream-is-dead-long-live-the-new-dream", "author":"Brent Holbert", "disqus_parent":"NULL", "disqus_id":"NULL", "status":"fresh", "status_parsed":0, "owner":""},

Women deserve top notch facilities that are able to deal with a myriad of complications.  As for doctors having admitting privileges...why the hell not?  If they are performing the procedure and something goes wrong, you can be damn sure that they need to be the one responsible for admitting a patient.  The question is...why don't they?  If the clinics and doctors truly want to provide the best care for their female patients...they would comply with these things.  The fact that the doctors do not makes them sound like those traveling abortionists from pre-Roe v Wade.\n\nReligious non-profits and Obamacare - Don't see a problem with this either.  HHS is more than capable of providing free birth control for women without involving these groups.  What angers me though is that free contraception is part of health plans in the first place.  If you are taking it for the sole purpose of preventing pregnancy - take some responsibility for your own actions and pay for it yourself.  The rest of us should not have to support you in this manner.  No one paid for us - we exercised personal responsibility and it did not break the bank...AND it wasn't even covered by any prescription co-pay program.\n\nOne person - one vote - The question is - why are these people included in a count for ANYTHING having to do with an election.

The biggest Ponzi scheme the world has ever seen , where the Banksters created credit out of thin air, not for their borrowers, but for the banksters themselves via the Federal Reserve\u2019s magic check book, with no bank account behind it. The Bankster then loaned that imaginary money to people on the security of overvalued real property with the deliberate aim of reducing the artificially raised property prices and putting people out of work.People without income cannot pay their bills, so they were guaranteed they could steal all that real property from their rightful owners. Of course you would say to yourself, that makes no sense because the Banksters would lose money when foreclosing on the security , but you\u2019d be wrong because the banksters insured the debt with an insurance company, but just forgot to tell the borrowers that. SO they knew they could not lose. Its what you might call having your cake and eating it too. You see, just secretly insuring the debt was the way they ensured that they lost no money. First they sold investors in Wall Street on the idea of using pensions and other fund moneys to invest in the profitable housing market. Then they sold homeowners on the idea of borrowing money against their rising property values, secure in knowing that they had artificially raised those prices and knew they could reverse that trend rapidly, when the time was right. Then they found another group of investors and sold them on insuring against the unlikely risk of those secure mortgages defaulting. But, as you know, they had already insured the downside risk. So they devised a new name that no one understood called the credit default swap. These were not insurance policies regulated by the states, but were unregulated securities sold on wall street to investors. So, once they got the business of insurance outside of the regulatory realm, it was no holds barred and they sold the same investment to up to 20 different groups in respect of every mortgage pool they pretended to create in the securitized mortgage scam.But people need to lose the mindset of someone who has been brainwashed by the garbage put out by government at state and federal level and echoed in the corporate owned media.SO therefore, The banksters along side Freddie and Fannie, were and still are continuing to submit fraudulent documents to the courts in order to steal homes from homeowners. They and their substitute trustee lawyers (ie Samuel I White PC, just one of many ) are submitting FRAUDULENT papers to the courts in order to FRAUDULENTLY foreclose on homeowners across the nation. Mortgage notes with Forged Owners signatures and ta-da endorsements are being submitted to the courts in order to steal homes. Bank of america(or as they like to refer to themselves\u2026fka countrywide) made a deal with the attorney generals to modify loans that they really had no right to modify as they were illegally acquired to begin with. They committed notary fraud, forgery, added fake endorsements and as their crimes began to come to light\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026they made a deal and instead of modifications (which they LED the homeowners to believe what was happening)\u2026.they handed the fraudulent documents over to Green Tree, now known as Ditech: corporate criminals are notorious for changing their names after lights shine on their crimes\u2026, among others, to foreclose. Meanwhile, homeowners are the ones who are paying the price by having their homes taken because of felonies that are being committed .

During the dark days of the late 70s and early 80s, if a full exchange happened, we're talking 30,000-50,000 nuclear weapons available. Not sure how many of those would actually make it to delivery, but everyone, and nearly every nation would be on the target list, lots of airbursts flattening and igniting cities, and ground bursts against transportation, with even the smallest switching yards or freeway interchanges getting a 'party favor'.The amount of smoke and blast particulates in the air would be more or less incalculable.  I'd fully expect multiple growing seasons to get shortened or eliminated.    This could also crash the diatom population at sea, stressing the Marine ecosystem for awhile.  Probably not permanent, but suddenly you're dealing with 5-10% of the world's previous agricultural output, and maybe 50-60% of the population.    If that isn't a recipe for chaos, I don't know what is.    Between human vs human and human vs environment, say maybe 5-10% of the world's population surviving at the end of the first decade.It isn't just about \"blast\" and megatons  it is all about what you do to the agricultural base / carrying capacity to the planet.
